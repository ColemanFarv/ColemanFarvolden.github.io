The LifeBot project develops an autonomous robot for swift AED deployment in indoor emergencies. It integrates Raspberry Pi, Arduino UNO WiFi Rev 2, and ROS2 for precise navigation. PID controllers ensure accurate motor control, while SLAM mapping and NAV2 enable autonomous navigation. Its technical prowess lies in advanced sensor integration, robust motor control, and efficient communication protocols for seamless operation in dynamic indoor environments.
