title: "An Accessible 6-axis testbed for image-guided robotics research"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'PURPOSE: Cancer can recur after tumor resection surgery if tumor tissue is missed and left behind. We hypothesize that intraoperative robotic imaging could be used to inspect the surgical cavity and localize residual cancer tissue. This technique has the potential to improve the success rate of tumor resection surgery. In this work, we propose and evaluate a benchtop testbed for robotic manipulation of an optical imaging probe. We use low-cost hardware and open-source software to construct the testbed and describe the implementation so that it can be easily adapted to other research areas. METHODS: We implemented a reusable, open-source module in 3D Slicer for reading position coordinates and motion planning with an inexpensive 6-axis robotic arm in Robot Operating System (ROS). For demonstration, a custom end-effector was used to fix an optical probe to the robot. To evaluate the accuracy of the testbed, a phantom with 16 target points was scanned using the robotic scanner. We then measured the positioning accuracy of the robot. RESULTS: The system had an average positional accuracy of 3.59  1.4 mm and the system successfully navigated to the majority of target points. CONCLUSIONS: Our open-source benchtop system achieves positional accuracy that would make it a valuable testbed for developing image-guided tumor inspection systems. Future work will explore the application of this test bed within breast conserving surgery.'
