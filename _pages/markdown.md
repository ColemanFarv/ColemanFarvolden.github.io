## ⛰️ The Outdoors

As an avid outdoorsman, I love being in the outdoors wheather it be 🥾 Hiking, 🏕️ camping, 🧗 rock climbing, and 🛶whitewater canoeing.

In 2022, I embarked on an unforgettable journey through the 🐻‍❄️ Arctic Circle. Over the course of 1200 kilometers, I navigated wild rivers, 🌄 encountered breathtaking landscapes, and experienced the beauty of the 🧭 North. This expedition was a true highlight of my life, pushing my limits and deepening my connection to the natural world.

I'm always seeking new adventures and opportunities to explore different 🏺 cultures and parts of the 🌎 world.

## 🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Triathlon

I began my Tri journey with a simple love for 🚴‍♂️ cycling around my 🛣️ house. This passion eventually led me to tryout for the university triathlon team, where I discovered a newfound intrest in 🏊‍♂️ swimming and 🏃‍♂️ running. I've honed my skills and developed a deep appreciation for the sport.

Recently, I took a significant step forward by completing the Muskoka Half 🧲 Ironman. This challenging race pushed me to my physical and mental limits, but the sense of accomplishment I felt at the finish line was amazing. My ultimate goal is to one day tackle a full 🧲 Ironman triathlon.

Beyond the physical challenges, triathlons have also brought me a strong sense of 🤝 community and friendship. The varsity triathlon team is filled with inspiring individuals who share a common passion for the sport. I have met lifelong friends who have supported me along the way.

## ⛑️ Volunteer First Aid

As a volunteer with Queen's First Aid, I've found a fulfilling way to combine my passion for 🩼 helping others with my commitment to community service. QFA provides first 🆘 emergency response services to everyone on the university campus. I Joined the team in my second year and after taking a 🕔 60 hour Advanced Medical First Responder course, I now volunteer on-call at least 6 hours a week.

The camaraderie and support within our team have made my time with the organization truly special. I've formed lasting friendships with my 👥 fellow volunteers.
