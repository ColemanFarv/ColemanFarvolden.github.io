## ⛰️ The Outdoors

As an avid outdoorsman, I love being in the outdoors wheather it be 🥾 Hiking, 🏕️ camping, 🧗 rock climbing, and 🛶whitewater canoeing.

In 2022, I embarked on an unforgettable journey through the 🐻‍❄️ Arctic Circle. Over the course of 1200 kilometers, I navigated wild rivers, 🌄 encountered breathtaking landscapes, and experienced the beauty of the 🧭 North. This expedition was a true highlight of my life, pushing my limits and deepening my connection to the natural world where there was almost no evidence of human existance.

I'm always seeking new adventures and opportunities to explore different 🏺 cultures and parts of the 🌎 world.

## Triathlon

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/colemanfarv.github.io/ColemanFarvolden.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built
* Academic Pages uses [Jekyll Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/), GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser, which is similar to the version of Markdown used on GitHub, but may have some minor differences. 
  * Some of emoji supported on GitHub should be supposed via the [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin :computer:.
  * The best list of the supported emoji can be found in the [Emojis for Jekyll via Jemoji](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-16-emojis_for_Jekyll/#computer) blog post.
